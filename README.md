### Get the codebase

To get started, clone this repo into `/home/pi/firmware`. The codebase depends on
being installed at /home/pi/firmware currently.

Once cloned locally, run:

`sudo bash /home/pi/firmware/bin/install.sh`

This master install script, in turn, runs the install
scripts for each system component - drivers, and kiosk.

## Functionality

### Hardware

#### Onboard Screen

Your Hackpack v4 is equipped with a capacitive-touch
screen, which duplicates the video output that can also be displayed normally via the HDMI output of the
Raspberry Pi.

#### Onboard LEDs

What Hackpack would be complete without NeoPixels? Your
Hackpack v4 sports 5 RGB NeoPixels, with a custom-built
unix socket that lets you control light patterns from

####  Onboard Gamepad

The `/drivers` directory contains all functionality
that drives the custom inputs on the device - namely
the joystick and control buttons.

## System Control

### Command-Line Interface

`hackpack kiosk start` - starts the kiosk webview
`hackpack kiosk stop` - stops the kiosk webview

`hackpack lights led_scanner` - play the led scanner light pattern
